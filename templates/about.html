<h1> About this webpage </h1>
<h2> Why NourishNeighbours </h2>
<p> Why did I choose this name?
    In this case, the grammar I used is intentionally ambiguous.
    Given the strong cohesion in our communities and the small land mass we share, we are all regarded as neighbors and help one another.
    Users can volunteer to be a nourisher, which means that they can choose to donate food they do not want/have too much of/about to expire soon to other people who need it more/do not mind consuming such food.
    On the other hand, users can volunteer to be nourished, which means that they can choose different foods from different categories based on what they desire.

<h2> Where? </h2>
<p> Currently, this app only operates in Singapore. </p>

<h2> What does this app do ? </h2>
<p> This app allows people to share food based on their locations, food allergies, and expiry date. </p>

<h2> Why this app? </h2>
<p> This app holds greater significance than it may appear at first glance.
    In our contemporary world, where food wastage is rampant, it's imperative that we recognize and appreciate the paramount importance of reducing this issue.
    Singaporean households discard a staggering 26,000 tonnes or S$342 million worth of unconsumed food annually, equivalent to two bowls of rice per person per day.
    Additionally, food waste constitutes approximately 10-12% of the total waste generated each year.

<p> Repurposing this excess food can lead to more compassionate and productive outcomes.
    Notably, Singaporeans are increasingly embracing the importance of addressing food waste.
    As evidenced by recent statistics, the food waste recycling rate increased from 14% in 2016 to 18% in 2022, offering hope for environmental conservation through effective waste reduction initiatives.
