#### Description:
Hello everyone, welcome to NourishNeighbor, which is a simple and useful food sharing app. 

Let's break down this project!

The motto of this app is to "Share more, waste less", so that users can share food items, which fosters cohesion in a community, combat the significant issue of food wastage. The objective of this app is for users to be able to share food conveniently, while reducing the fear of receiving food that they might be unable to consume based on their own reasons, e.g, food allergy, religious reasons, etc. 

Food wastage is a problem that is often overlooked/undermined in the world. Often, many people do not fully fathom the detrimental effects food wastage can bring to the environment. Some effects include producing greenhouse gases such as methane, as well as the wastage of sources allocated to produce food. In Singapore, where 90% of our food is imported, it is pivotal that we do consume food efficiently. 

In the templates page, there are a few html pages, with homepage.html as the parent template. 

In the main folder, there are the files, app.py, helper.py, nourish.db and schema.sql

app.py contains the main flask route of the app, nourish.db is the main database of the app.

My design philosophy keeps things modern and eco-friendly, utilizing a simple black and white color scheme with green accents to emphasize the importance of environmental conservation.

The main gist of this project is to provide a platform for users to be able to share the food that they have excess of/ do not wish to consume. Instead of throwing away these still-edible food, users will be able to share the food to other users who might want it instead. 

In the world of NourishNeighbor, two key personas emerge - 'Nourishers' and 'Nourished'. Nourisher refers to those who wish to share their food with others while nourished refers to those who seek to benefit from the shared resources.

This app is unique(hopefully) in a way where users can filter out food which contain ingredients that they might be allergic to/ have dietary restrictions to given their own reasons. Therefore, it is important for those listing their food to be as accurate as they can, to allow receivers to make more well informed choices. 

The location input allows users to be able to choose listings that might be closer to them so as to reduce travel time and increase covenience for both the nourisher and the nourished. The additional chatroom will enable users to seamlessly finalize coordination for pickup or delivery. 

I do sincerely hope that through this app, users will be able to reduce food waste, as well as gain joy from sharing food, which would have otherwise gone to waste. The days of guilt from discarding perfectly edible food are over and now comes the new age of saving the environment.
